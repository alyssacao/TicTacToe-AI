# Tic-Tac-Toe Adversarial Search

This project implements the MiniMax adversarial search algorithm and its variant with alpha-beta pruning to play the game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
**Installation**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the program with Python 3:
python filename ALGO FIRST MODE
where: ALGO: 1 for MiniMax or 2 for MiniMax with alpha-beta pruning.
       FIRST: who begins the game 'X' or 'O'.
       MODE: 1 for human (X) versus computer (O) or 2 for computer (X) versus computer (O).
**Usage**
To play against the computer, execute the program with appropriate command line arguments.
Follow the prompts to make your moves and see the computer's moves.
Game results will be displayed at the end.
**What I learned**
- Implemented MiniMax adversarial search algorithm and its variant with alpha-beta pruning for playing Tic-Tac-Toe.
- Designed a command line interface allowing users to specify game settings and interact with the program.
- Analyzed and compared the performance of MiniMax and alpha-beta pruning by measuring the number of search tree nodes generated.
